Explain:


How to create virtual environment


How to install requirements


How to run Flask


Example:
# Service Bot Project

## Setup

1. Create virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv



Activate virtual environment


# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate



Install dependencies


pip install -r requirements.txt



Place your Google credentials.json in the project folder.


Run Flask app


python app.py

## **Step 4: Deployment Preparation (Optional)**

If your client wants it live, you can later deploy to:

- **Render.com** (free tier)
- **PythonAnywhere**
- **Heroku** (requires extra setup)

---

If you want, I can **write a full ready-to-deploy guide for your repo**, including `.gitignore`, updated `requirements.txt`, and proper instructions so your client can just clone and run it.  

Do you want me to do that?
